A small cmd too for issuing an asset on stellar.

## Setup
To install mint, just use a simple go get command  
```sh 
$ go get github.com/adirutwn/mint
```  
And don't forget to properly configured $GOPATH directory, with `$GOPATH/bin` added to your `PATH`
```sh
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATh/bin
```
You can now run the command `mint` from anywhere in your terminal.
